# Git Talks

This repository contains the source code for Go talks that I have given (just one so far).

## Installation

Run the examples with present (note that by default this allows arbitrary code execution on your computer)

- [Install Go](http://golang.org)
- `go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/present`
- `go get github.com/rszewczyk/gotalks`
- `cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/rszewczyk/gotalks`
- `present`
